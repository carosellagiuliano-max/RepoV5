### üéØ Development Approach

#### Constraints to Respect
- ‚ùå No changes to existing customer-facing UI/styling
- ‚ùå No modifications to existing CSS, Tailwind config
- ‚ùå No renaming of existing environment variables
- ‚úÖ Add new files in: `src/admin/**`, `src/lib/**`, `src/hooks/**`
- ‚úÖ Create new Netlify functions for backend features
- ‚úÖ Add new TypeScript types and interfaces
- ‚úÖ Extend documentation and testing

#### Recommended Implementation Patterns
1. **Backend-First Development**: Create API endpoints first
2. **TypeScript-First**: Define interfaces before implementation
3. **Component Composition**: Reuse existing UI components
