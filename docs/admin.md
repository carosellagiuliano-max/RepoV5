#### DELETE - Cancel Appointment
```
DELETE /admin/appointments/{appointmentId}
```
Soft delete - marks as cancelled. Cannot delete completed appointments.

## Business Logic

### Conflict Detection
The system automatically prevents:
- Double-booking staff members
- Booking during staff time-off
- Booking outside staff availability hours
- Booking services not offered by staff member
- Booking in the past

### Appointment Workflow
1. **Pending**: Initial status when customer books
2. **Confirmed**: Admin/staff confirms the appointment
3. **Completed**: Service finished, revenue recorded
4. **Cancelled**: Appointment cancelled (with reason)
5. **No Show**: Customer didn't arrive

### Staff Availability
- Weekly recurring schedule (Monday=1, Sunday=0)
- Time ranges for each day (e.g., 09:00-18:00)
- Individual time-off periods override availability
- Time-off requires approval workflow

### Service Assignment
- Many-to-many relationship between staff and services
- Custom pricing per staff-service combination
- Staff can only be booked for assigned services

## Data Validation

### Required Fields
- **Staff**: email, first_name, last_name
- **Service**: name, duration_minutes, price_cents
- **Appointment**: customer_id, staff_id, service_id, start_time, end_time

### Constraints
- Email must be unique and valid format
- Phone must match international format
- Hourly rate and commission rate must be positive
- Service duration must be positive
- Appointment end_time must be after start_time
- Time-off end_date must be after start_date

### Business Rules
- Cannot delete staff/services with future appointments
- Cannot book appointments in the past
- Staff must be active to receive bookings
- Services must be active to be bookable
- Media files are only accessible via signed URLs ðŸ†•
- Only admin users can upload/delete media files ðŸ†•
- File size limited to 10MB by default ðŸ†•
- Supported file types: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, MP4, WebM, MOV ðŸ†•

## Error Handling

### Common Error Codes
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Request data validation failed
- `STAFF_NOT_FOUND`: Staff member doesn't exist
- `SERVICE_NOT_FOUND`: Service doesn't exist
- `APPOINTMENT_CONFLICT`: Time slot conflicts
- `STAFF_SERVICE_MISMATCH`: Staff doesn't offer service
- `HAS_FUTURE_APPOINTMENTS`: Cannot delete with future bookings
- `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS`: User lacks required role
- `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: Too many requests
- `MEDIA_NOT_FOUND`: Media file doesn't exist ðŸ†•
- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`: Upload exceeds size limit ðŸ†•
- `INVALID_FILE_TYPE`: File type not allowed ðŸ†•
- `FILE_NOT_FOUND`: File not found in storage ðŸ†•
- `UPLOAD_FAILED`: File upload to storage failed ðŸ†•

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Staff member does not offer this service",
    "code": "STAFF_SERVICE_MISMATCH",
    "details": {
      "staffId": "uuid",
      "serviceId": "uuid"
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Efficient pagination with LIMIT/OFFSET
- Optimized joins in views
- Conflict checking via database functions

### Caching Strategy
- Business settings cached for 5 minutes
- Staff availability cached for 1 minute
- Service catalog cached for 10 minutes

### Rate Limiting
- Admin operations: 50 requests/minute
- General API: 100 requests/minute
- Booking creation: 10 requests/minute (stricter)

## Security

### Data Protection
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- JWT token validation
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging with correlation IDs

### GDPR Compliance
- Soft delete for customer data
- Data export capabilities
- Anonymization of old records
- Consent tracking (future feature)

## Monitoring & Logging

### Structured Logging
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "correlationId": "req_1234567890_abc123",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Staff member created successfully",
  "userId": "uuid",
  "staffId": "uuid"
}
```

### Key Metrics
- API response times
- Error rates by endpoint
- Authentication failures
- Database query performance

## Business Settings Management ðŸ†•

### Overview
The business settings system provides centralized configuration management for all business operations. Settings are stored in the database and can be managed through the admin interface.

### Settings Categories

#### Business Information
- **Business Name**: Display name for the salon
- **Address**: Physical business address
- **Phone**: Contact phone number  
- **Email**: Business email address
- **Opening Hours**: Configurable hours for each day of the week

#### Booking Configuration
- **Booking Window**: Maximum days in advance customers can book (1-365 days)
- **Buffer Time**: Minutes between appointments (0-120 minutes)
- **Cancellation Hours**: Minimum notice required for cancellations (0-168 hours)

#### Email & SMTP Configuration
- **SMTP Host**: Email server hostname
- **SMTP Port**: Server port (typically 587 or 465)
- **SMTP User**: Authentication username
- **SMTP Password**: Authentication password (encrypted)
- **From Email**: Sender email address
- **From Name**: Sender display name

### Admin UI Features

#### Settings Management Interface
- **Tabbed Interface**: Organized by category (Business, Booking, Email)
- **Real-time Validation**: Form validation with helpful error messages
- **Visual Feedback**: Live preview of setting effects
- **Audit Trail**: Track who made changes and when

#### Opening Hours Configuration
- **Day-by-day Setup**: Enable/disable and set hours for each day
- **Visual Schedule**: Clear display of business hours
- **Flexible Timing**: Support for different hours per day

#### SMTP Testing
- **Configuration Test**: Send test emails to verify setup
- **Error Diagnosis**: Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- **Security**: Sensitive credentials are masked in the UI

### Security & Access Control

#### Role-Based Access
- **Admin**: Full access to all settings including sensitive data
- **Staff**: Read-only access to non-sensitive settings
- **Customer**: No access to business settings

#### Data Protection
- **Sensitive Settings**: SMTP passwords and other credentials are encrypted
- **Audit Logging**: All changes are tracked with user and timestamp
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have appropriate rate limits

### Integration with Booking System

#### How Settings Affect Bookings
- **Opening Hours**: Determines available appointment slots
- **Buffer Time**: Automatically added between appointments
- **Booking Window**: Limits how far in advance customers can book
- **Cancellation Policy**: Enforced in the booking interface

#### Real-time Updates
- Settings changes take effect immediately
- React Query cache invalidation ensures UI stays synchronized
- No server restart required for configuration changes

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE settings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  key TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  value JSONB NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  category TEXT DEFAULT 'general',
  is_sensitive BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id)
);
```

#### API Architecture
