#### DELETE - Cancel Appointment
```
DELETE /admin/appointments/{appointmentId}
```
Soft delete - marks as cancelled. Cannot delete completed appointments.

## Business Logic

### Conflict Detection
The system automatically prevents:
- Double-booking staff members
- Booking during staff time-off
- Booking outside staff availability hours
- Booking services not offered by staff member
- Booking in the past

### Appointment Workflow
1. **Pending**: Initial status when customer books
2. **Confirmed**: Admin/staff confirms the appointment
3. **Completed**: Service finished, revenue recorded
4. **Cancelled**: Appointment cancelled (with reason)
5. **No Show**: Customer didn't arrive

### Staff Availability
- Weekly recurring schedule (Monday=1, Sunday=0)
- Time ranges for each day (e.g., 09:00-18:00)
- Individual time-off periods override availability
- Time-off requires approval workflow

### Service Assignment
- Many-to-many relationship between staff and services
- Custom pricing per staff-service combination
- Staff can only be booked for assigned services

## Data Validation

### Required Fields
- **Staff**: email, first_name, last_name
- **Service**: name, duration_minutes, price_cents
- **Appointment**: customer_id, staff_id, service_id, start_time, end_time

### Constraints
- Email must be unique and valid format
- Phone must match international format
- Hourly rate and commission rate must be positive
- Service duration must be positive
- Appointment end_time must be after start_time
- Time-off end_date must be after start_date

### Business Rules
- Cannot delete staff/services with future appointments
- Cannot book appointments in the past
- Staff must be active to receive bookings
- Services must be active to be bookable

## Error Handling

### Common Error Codes
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Request data validation failed
- `STAFF_NOT_FOUND`: Staff member doesn't exist
- `SERVICE_NOT_FOUND`: Service doesn't exist
- `APPOINTMENT_CONFLICT`: Time slot conflicts
- `STAFF_SERVICE_MISMATCH`: Staff doesn't offer service
- `HAS_FUTURE_APPOINTMENTS`: Cannot delete with future bookings
- `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS`: User lacks required role
- `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: Too many requests

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Staff member does not offer this service",
    "code": "STAFF_SERVICE_MISMATCH",
    "details": {
      "staffId": "uuid",
      "serviceId": "uuid"
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Efficient pagination with LIMIT/OFFSET
- Optimized joins in views
- Conflict checking via database functions

### Caching Strategy
- Business settings cached for 5 minutes
- Staff availability cached for 1 minute
- Service catalog cached for 10 minutes

### Rate Limiting
- Admin operations: 50 requests/minute
- General API: 100 requests/minute
- Booking creation: 10 requests/minute (stricter)

## Security

### Data Protection
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- JWT token validation
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging with correlation IDs

### GDPR Compliance
- Soft delete for customer data
- Data export capabilities
- Anonymization of old records
- Consent tracking (future feature)

## Monitoring & Logging

### Structured Logging
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "correlationId": "req_1234567890_abc123",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Staff member created successfully",
  "userId": "uuid",
  "staffId": "uuid"
}
```

### Key Metrics
- API response times
- Error rates by endpoint
- Authentication failures
- Database query performance

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
