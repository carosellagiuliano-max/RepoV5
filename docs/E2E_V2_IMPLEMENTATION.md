- ❌ **Zero changes** to customer frontend appearance
- ✅ **All new files** in permitted directories only
- ✅ **Validated** with design-lock.js script

#### 🔧 **Database & Test Data**
- ✅ Comprehensive test data seeding (users, services, availability)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup after test runs
- ✅ RBAC test users with proper role assignments
- ✅ Isolated test environment with no production impact

#### 📋 **Environment Configuration**
- ✅ Updated `.env.example` with E2E variables
- ✅ Supabase integration for test data management
- ✅ JWT validation and RBAC testing
- ✅ Mock/sandbox mode for external services

## 🎯 **Test Scenarios Covered**

### 1. Customer Booking Journey
```typescript
✅ Service search and filtering
✅ Staff selection (specific or any)
✅ Date/time slot selection
✅ Customer info form validation
✅ Booking confirmation flow
✅ Cancellation with idempotency
✅ Edge cases (conflicts, network errors)
```

### 2. Admin Portal Management
```typescript
✅ Staff CRUD with active/inactive states
✅ Services management with categories
✅ Customer management with GDPR compliance
✅ Appointment scheduling with conflict detection
✅ Media upload and gallery management
✅ Business settings configuration
```

### 3. RBAC Security Validation
```typescript
✅ Admin: Full access validation
✅ Staff: Limited access with PII masking
✅ Receptionist: Appointment-only permissions
✅ Customer: Self-service restrictions
✅ API endpoint protection (401/403 testing)
✅ Role transition auditing
```

### 4. Production Readiness
```typescript
✅ /api/health endpoint with correlation IDs
✅ SEO meta tags and structured data (Schema.org)
✅ robots.txt and sitemap.xml validation
✅ PWA manifest and service worker checks
✅ Accessibility and performance basics
✅ Security headers validation
```

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### Local Development
```bash
# Full E2E test cycle
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps
npm run build
npm run test:playwright

# Quick single test
npx playwright test booking.spec.ts --headed

# Test with UI mode
npx playwright test --ui
```

### CI/CD Integration
- **Auto-triggered**: On push to main or PR creation
- **Preview deployment**: Automatic Netlify preview for PRs
- **Matrix testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari across 2 shards
- **Artifacts**: Test reports, traces, videos, screenshots

### Test Data Management
```bash
# Seed test data
npm run seed-test-data

# Clean test data
npm run clean-test-data

# Full cycle (included in CI)
npm run test:e2e:full
```

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

### ✅ **Quality Assurance**
